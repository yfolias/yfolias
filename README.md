## About me
My name is Yannis Folias and I am currently working as a Cloud Native Security Engineer, on behalf of Control Plane. A huge advocate of the SecDevOps principles, coming from a DevOps background, implementing everything with security in mind. Starting from the infrastructure level and going all the way down to the application and supply chain stuff.

Feel free to contact me if you're keen to have a chat or even just say hello.

## Qualifications
* Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA)
* Certified Kubernetes Developer (CKAD)
* Offensive Security Certified Professional (OSCP)

Academically, I've got a Bsc in Computer Systems Engineering, from the Piraeus University of Applied Sciences, as well as an Msc in Advanced Security and Digital Forensics, by the Napier University of Edinburgh.

## Interests
As mentioned in my introduction, my interests revolve around security but just to be a little bit more specific, it's all about security in the Cloud Native world, including: 
- [x] Kubernetes and containers
- [x] CI/CD pipelines
- [x] Code
- [x] Microservices
- [x] Various cloud vendors

Some scripting is also a necessary part of the story. Even though I was always writing scripts in Bash or Python, lately I've managed to fall in love with Golang and I was able to build some pretty cool stuff which I will start publishing in due course.

## Projects
Coming soon

## Blogging
Currently building my personal website https://yannisfolias.com

Also planning to become active on dev.to as well as on medium.
